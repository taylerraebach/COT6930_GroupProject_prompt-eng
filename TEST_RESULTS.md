### Generative Knowledge (Correct)
Generated Knowledge:
To solve this problem, we need to know a bit about chemistry and molecular structure.

The molecule in question is C₂H₆O, which consists of two carbon atoms (C), six hydrogen atoms (H), and one oxygen atom (O).

Here's the relevant background knowledge:

1. Atomic masses:
 * Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
 * Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
 * Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol
2. Molecular structure: C₂H₆O has a molecular formula that indicates it's an aldehyde, which is a type of organic compound. The molecule consists of two carbon atoms bonded to each other, with one hydrogen atom attached to each

Final Answer:
To find the molar mass of C₂H₆O, we need to add up the atomic masses of its constituent elements.

1. Carbon (C): 2 atoms x 12.01 g/mol (approx.) = 24.02 g/mol
2. Hydrogen (H): 6 atoms x 1.008 g/mol = 6.048 g/mol
3. Oxygen (O): 1 atom x 16.00 g/mol = 16.00 g/mol

Now, let's add up the atomic masses:
24.02 + 6.048 + 16.00 = 46.068 g/mol

The molar mass of C₂H₆O is approximately 46.

## PROMPT 2: Balance the reaction: C₃H₈ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O

### Zero Shot (Incomplete and Incorrect)
To balance the reaction, we need to add coefficients in front of the reactants and products until the number of atoms of each element is equal on both sides.

Initial reaction:

C₃H₈ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O

### Prompt Chaining (Incomplete and Incorrect)
Step 1 Output:
To balance the reaction, let's break it down into smaller steps. Here's how we can do it:

1. Write down the unbalanced equation:
   C₃H₈ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O

2. Balance the carbon atoms: There are 3 carbon atoms on the left side of the equation and only 1 on the right side.
   We need to multiply CO₂ by 3 to balance the carbon atoms.
   
   The new equation is:

I can help with that. Here's the revised version:


   C + O2 → CO2


To balance it further, we'll add H2O to both sides.

### Generate Knowledge (Incomplete)
Generated Knowledge:
To balance the given reaction, we need to consider the law of conservation of mass. The law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.

The unbalanced equation is:
C₃H₈ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O

Let's look at the reactants and products:

Reactants:

1. C₃H₈ (propane) - 3 carbon atoms, 8 hydrogen atoms
2. O₂ (oxygen gas) - 2 oxygen atoms

Products:

1. CO₂ (carbon dioxide) - 1 carbon atom, 2 oxygen atoms
2. H₂O (water) - 2 hydrogen atoms, 1 oxygen atom

Now, let's compare the

Final Answer:
To balance the reaction, we need to make sure that the number of atoms of each element is equal on both the reactant and product sides.

Let's start by comparing the oxygen atoms:

* Reactants: 2 oxygen atoms (O₂)
* Products: 3 oxygen atoms (CO₂ + H₂O)

To balance the oxygen atoms, we need to add more O₂ molecules to the reaction. Let's try adding 1/2 molecule of O₂ to both sides of the reaction.

Now, let's compare the carbon atoms:

* Reactants: None
* Products: No carbon atoms (just oxygen and hydrogen)

We don't need to add any additional reactant molecules to balance the carbon atoms.

### Generative Knowledge
Generated Knowledge:
To determine the limiting reactant, we need to know the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.

The balanced equation is already given: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O

From the equation, we can see that:

* 1 mole of H2 reacts with 0.5 moles of O2
* 1 mole of O2 reacts with 2 moles of H2

Now, let's look at the amounts of reactants given in the problem:

* Moles of H2: 5 moles
* Moles of O2: 2 moles

To determine which reaction is limiting (i.e., will be consumed first), we need to calculate the number of moles of
