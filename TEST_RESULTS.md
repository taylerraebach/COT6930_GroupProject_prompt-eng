### Prompt Chaining
Step 1 Output:
Here are the simplified steps to find the molar mass of C₂H₆O:

**Step 1: Find the atomic masses of each element**

- Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of approximately 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1.008 g/mol
- Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16.00 g/mol

**Step 2: Determine the number of atoms for each element

Final Output:
To find the total molecular weight, we need to calculate the number of atoms for each element.

The chemical formula for ethylene oxide is C₂H₄O. Based on this formula:

* There are 2 carbon (C) atoms.
* There are 4 hydrogen (H) atoms.
* There is 1 oxygen (O) atom.

Now, we can calculate the total molecular weight using these values:

Atomic weight of C = 12 g/mol
Atomic weight of H =

### Generative Knowledge
Generated Knowledge:
To solve this problem, we need to know a bit about chemistry and molecular structure.

The molecule in question is C₂H₆O, which consists of two carbon atoms (C), six hydrogen atoms (H), and one oxygen atom (O).

Here's the relevant background knowledge:

1. Atomic masses:
 * Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
 * Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
 * Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol
2. Molecular structure: C₂H₆O has a molecular formula that indicates it's an aldehyde, which is a type of organic compound. The molecule consists of two carbon atoms bonded to each other, with one hydrogen atom attached to each

Final Answer:
To find the molar mass of C₂H₆O, we need to add up the atomic masses of its constituent elements.

1. Carbon (C): 2 atoms x 12.01 g/mol (approx.) = 24.02 g/mol
2. Hydrogen (H): 6 atoms x 1.008 g/mol = 6.048 g/mol
3. Oxygen (O): 1 atom x 16.00 g/mol = 16.00 g/mol

Now, let's add up the atomic masses:
24.02 + 6.048 + 16.00 = 46.068 g/mol

The molar mass of C₂H₆O is approximately 46.

## PROMPT 3: What is the limiting reactant in 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O if we have 5 moles of H₂ and 2 moles of O₂?

### Zero Shot
To determine the limiting reactant, we need to write out the balanced equation for the reaction:

4H2 + O2 → 2H2O (Note: the correct stoichiometry is 4H2 for every 1 O2)

Now, let's analyze the amounts of H2 and O2 you provided:

* 4H2 (required) vs. 2H2 (available)
	+ Shortage by 50% (you need 2 times more than

Time taken: 34.065s

### Few Shot
We start by identifying the number of moles of H2 needed to completely consume all 2 moles of O2, which is 2 * 1 = 2 moles. Since we have more than that amount available (we only need half), they will suffice. 

So, 2/4 = 0.5
