# Research Method

To build this research process, we are following a systematic, iterative approach that involves both technical development and user feedback loops.

## Defining the Scope and Objectives:

* The research begins by clearly defining the goal of the AI-powered study companion: to assist General Chemistry students with problem-solving, concept explanations, and interactive learning.
* We set specific objectives, such as implementing NLP capabilities for accurate question answering, building a quiz system for student engagement, and integrating visual aids for complex topics.

## System Design and Development:

* We are using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to train the bot on a large corpus of chemistry knowledge. This will help the bot understand and respond to a wide range of student queries effectively.
* The bot is being developed on Discord as a platform to ensure accessibility and ease of use for students in a familiar environment. We integrate it with features such as direct messaging, channel interactions, and multi-step workflows for guided problem-solving.

## User Interaction Testing:

* The bot undergoes user testing with General Chemistry students to gather feedback on its accuracy, usability, and engagement level.
* Students interact with the bot by asking questions, taking quizzes, and using the problem-solving features. Their input is used to refine the bot’s responses and functionality.
* We also conduct A/B testing on various features, like quiz difficulty, to identify what works best for different user groups.

## Iterative Refinement:

* Based on feedback and performance data, we continuously refine the bot’s knowledge base, improve its NLP capabilities, and enhance its interactive features.
* Regular updates ensure the bot evolves to better meet students' needs and align with common chemistry challenges.

## Data Analytics and Evaluation:

* We collect and analyze user interaction data to evaluate the bot's effectiveness in helping students learn and understand General Chemistry concepts. This data helps identify areas for improvement and adapt the bot’s functionality for better educational outcomes.

By combining technical development with user-centered design and continuous feedback, we ensure the research process is iterative, adaptable, and focused on creating a highly effective and engaging study companion.
