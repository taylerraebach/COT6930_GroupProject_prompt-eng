By systematically testing and refining prompt engineering techniques, this research aims to develop a highly effective AI chatbot tailored to enhancing student learning in General Chemistry. The findings will contribute valuable insights into optimizing AI-driven educational tools for personalized and interactive study experiences.

# Results
Through extensive testing, generative knowledge-based prompting emerged as the most effective technique. Unlike other methods that either provided incomplete, incorrect, or overly simplistic responses, generative knowledge prompts consistently produced the most accurate and well-explained answers.

Overall, generative knowledge prompting provided the most educationally valuable responses, not only delivering correct answers but also breaking down the concepts into clear, structured explanations. This approach significantly enhanced student learning by reinforcing problem-solving techniques, increasing comprehension, and making complex chemistry concepts more accessible. The findings suggest that integrating generative knowledge-based prompting into AI-powered educational chatbots can lead to more effective, engaging, and pedagogically sound learning experiences.

# Further research
Moving forward, several avenues for further research can be explored to enhance AI-powered study companions. One possibility is refining Generative Knowledge prompting to optimize response time while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, integrating multimodal learning—such as visual aids and interactive simulations—could further improve student engagement and comprehension. Another potential direction is personalizing responses based on individual learning styles, allowing the AI to adapt to different student needs dynamically. Lastly, testing these AI-driven tools across different STEM subjects could validate the broader applicability of effective prompt engineering strategies beyond chemistry. These future research directions would help create more adaptive and intelligent study tools that maximize educational impact.
