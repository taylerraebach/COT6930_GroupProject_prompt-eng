# Results
We tested three different prompts, each relating to solving general chemistry problems, and out of all the prompt techniques we tried, generative prompting was the best. It not only gave background knowledge to the students, which contributed to the goal of helping them study, but showed students how to solve the problem. Also, it was the only technique that consistently gave correct answers, the other techniques did not always give correct answers.
